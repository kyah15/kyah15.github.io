        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>The purpose of <i><b>The Weather Site</b></i> is to give current weather conditions in 3 different ways. The initial page will give the <br>
            weather for the current location based on the Geocoding location information from the device.  The second is weather for <br>
            3 specific locations accessible through a dedicated link, and the third is weather for any location determined by a search <br>
            string.</p>

        <h2>Audience</h2>
        <p>Primary audience is adults ages 18-30.  Most will be students.  Access to the site will be split between mobile devices <br>
            and laptops. A secondary audience will be anyone interested in weather.</p>

        <h3>Audience Goals</h3>
        <p>College students move around quite a bit so one goal would be to quickly get the weather conditions for their current <br>
            location as they head off to class or study. They are also often far from their homes so the ability to quickly get the <br>
            conditions for a specific location is important as well.  The third goal deals with planning for travels...the ability to <br>
            get weather conditions for any location will help with last minute packing for road trips.</p>
            
        <h3>Persona</h3>
        <img src= "/kyah15.github.io/weather/images/cool-joe.jpg" alt="Funny Doggy">
        <ul>
            <li><b> Name: </b>Joe Cool</li>
            <li><b> Occupation:</b> Student</li>
            <li><b > Age: </b> Eternally 18</li>
            <li><b> Interests: </b> Traveling, Flying, Play Acting, Eating </li>
            <li><b> Motivation: </b> Joe is not into planning. His last minute scrampling, whether it is getting to calss in the morning or <br>
                heading out on his latest adventure, has left him unprepared for weather. conditions many times (He is tired of <br>
                sleeping in the rain and snow).  He would like to be more prepared...without having to put much effort into it...or <br>
                planning.</li>
            <li><b> Environment: </b> Joe is comfortable using laptops and Mobile devices, he will most often be found on a smart phone however. <br>
                Many of the places he frequents do not have great signalâ€¦he is often dealing with 3G speeds </li>
        </ul>
            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>All weather pages should include location name, current temperature, forecast high, forecast low, current weather <br>
                descriptor, forecast percentage of precipitation, and current wind speed and direction on small devices and hourly <br>
                temps should be added on larger screens. The pages of the <b><i>Weather Site</i></b> will be built in the following order:</p>
            <h3>Pages</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><b> Franklin and Greenville </b> weather for each specific location. The weather for these pages should be pulled <br>
                    from the weather.JSON file that will be provided.</li>
                <li><b> Current: </b> weather for the current location. Current location should be determined by using the Geolocation <br>
                    API of the browser. This information should be passed to the National Weather Service (NWS) API to retrieve <br>
                    the current conditions.</li>
                <li><b> Search: </b> Begins with only a search box, characters entered will cause a list of suggested matches to appear. <br>
                    Selected location will pull up the weather.</li>
            </ol>
